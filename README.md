# Paper Title: 
DeepNetBeam: A Framework for the Analysis of Functionally Graded Porous Beams

**Abstract**
This study introduces a framework, named DeepNetBeam (DNB), based on Scientific Machine Learning
(SciML) for the analysis of functionally graded (FG) porous beams. The beam material properties
are assumed to vary as an arbitrary continuous function. The DNB framework considers the output
of a neural network/operator as an approximation to the displacement fields and derives the equations
governing beam behavior based on the continuum formulation. The framework is formulated by three
approaches: (a) the vector approach leads to Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), (b) the energy
approach brings about Deep Energy Method (DEM), and (c) the data-driven approach, results in a class
of Neural Operator methods. Finally, a neural operator has been trained to predict the response of FG
porous beam under any porosity distribution pattern and any arbitrary traction condition. The results
are validated with analytical and numerical reference solutions.
